"""
ML learning models understand numbers not text

Machine learning models canâ€™t process text directly, they need numbers.

One-hot encoding turns categorical variables into binary vectors without implying any order, making them model-friendly without misleading the algorithm.

What It Shows
Converts each category in the Color column into its binary column
Each row has a 1 in the column that matches its category
Zero assumption of order, pure categorical handling
