"""
Why numpy vectors are faster than loops?
Vectorization in NumPy allows you to apply operations on whole arrays without writing manual loops.

Itâ€™s cleaner, faster, and ideal for handling large datasets.
Using optimized C code under the hood supercharges performance and is a must-know for every data scientist.

import numpy as np
import time

size = 1_000_000
a = np.random.rand(size)
b = np.random.rand(size)

start = time.time()

# Traditional loop
result = []
for i in range(size):
    result.append(a[i] + b[i])
print("Loop Time:", round(time.time() - start, 4), "seconds")

# Vectorized operation
start = time.time()
result_vectorized = a + b
print("Vectorized Time:", round(time.time() - start, 4), "seconds")
